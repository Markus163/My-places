## My places



This project is a collection of different places that you have visited or want to visit (restaurants, cafes, bars, parks, attractions, etc.).

You can create a new place card: image, name, location, type, rating.

You can set a route to a place in the app.

In this project I used Realm, MapKit, the interface was developed in Storyboard.
